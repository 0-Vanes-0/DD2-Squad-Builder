Also feel free to fork and suggest a pull request if you'd like to make the utility better or to help with one of tasks from the roadmap.

## USAGE
• This web utility helps to build a squad for [Darkest Dungeon 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1940340/Darkest_Dungeon_II/) and to share it with anybody.
E.g. someone asks: 
> *"Recommend me a broken comp for K3"*

and instead of writing
> "PD Physician, Jester Wanderer, BH, Leper Monarch"
>
> and much text about skills

you can just send **squad code** that also includes chosen skills for each hero. The one who asked will just copy-paste it here to see heroes and skills (allow browser to see your clipboard data).

• How to form a squad?              
1. In Heroes tab, drag&drop a hero-path to one of rank slots. You should fill all 4 ranks.
2. In Skills tab, drag&drop skills to one of skill slots. You should fill all 5 slots (in case of Abomination - 9 slots).
3. Look at the summary below, copy or save your current squad (it will appear in Saved Squads tab).

• All other information is located within the utility in Info tab.
