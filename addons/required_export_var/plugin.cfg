name="Automatic Required Export Variable"
description="Tired of writing @export for nodes each time? This plugin overrides |drag & drop + Ctrl| behavior (that inserted node as @onready variable, which is worse imho). Now, if you do this - it will insert @export var node_name: ItsClassName and also it will add this new variable to assert() function in the beginning of _ready() function. Besides, new @export variables will have @export_group(\"Required Children\") above for additional comfort. After dropping all nodes you want, assign them in the node that has the script. Done! Now you can teleport bread... you can rename and move your nodes as much as you like."
